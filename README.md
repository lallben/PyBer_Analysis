# PyBer_Analysis
PyBer is a Ride Share service, this is analytics performed on their data
## Project Overview & Objective:
As a data analyst at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. I have been assigned a project to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.
I am charged to create charts and visualizations that will help PyBer determine Access to Ride Sharing Services and determine Affordability for under served neighborhoods. 
This will be accomplished by analysis ride sharing data and chart relationships between neighborhoods served, driver counts & fares charged.
## Lists & Deliverables:
Importing data into a Pandas DataFrame.<br>
Merge DataFrames.<br>
Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.<br>
Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:<br>
<i>The total number of rides for each city type.<br>
The average fares for each city type.<br>
The total number of drivers for each city type.</i><br>
Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
<i>The number of rides for each city type.<br>
The fares for each city type.<br>
The number of drivers for each city type.<br></i>
Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:<br>
<i>The percent of total fares.<br>
The percent of total rides.<br>
The percent of total drivers.</i><br>
## The Challenge:
Using Python and knowledge of Pandas, we need to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we need to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.<br> 
Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
